                        With little fanfare, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has announced work has begun on the next iteration of the Web's most crucial standard, HTML5.1.
                        The interesting part: The spec is being shaped on GitHub, which used to manage much of the source code for the projects that use HTML5.
                        W3C says its plans for HTML5 are "to match reality better, to make the specification as clear as possible to readers, and of course to make it possible
                        for all stakeholders to propose improvements, and understand what makes changes to HTML successful."
                        Early drafts the HTML5 spec began to surface back in 2008, but it wasn't until 2014 that HTML5 was considered
                        an endorsed, official standard. Consequently, the W3C wants to make incremental updates "a reality that is relatively
                        straightforward to implement," in order to avoid the years-long lag that hobbled the spec's last revision.
